Network Log Forwarder

A lightweight, modular C implementation for collecting and forwarding logs over TCP/UDP. Designed to bridge legacy TCP-based clients with modern UDP-only logging backends.

📦 Overview

This project provides three core utilities:
udp_server: Listens on a UDP port and appends all received datagrams to a log file.
tcp_server: Accepts TCP connections and forwards every received byte to a configured UDP endpoint (acts as a TCP-to-UDP bridge).
test_client: Sends formatted log messages via TCP or UDP for testing and simulation.

Built with simplicity, reliability, and POSIX compliance in mind—ideal for embedded systems, legacy integration, or custom logging pipelines.

Usage
1. Start the UDP Log Collector
./bin/udp_server <udp_port> <log_file>
Example:
bash
./bin/udp_server 5140 /var/log/app.log
Listens on UDP port 5140
Appends all incoming datagrams to /var/log/app.log
Runs indefinitely until terminated

2. (Optional) Start the TCP-to-UDP Bridge

bash
./bin/tcp_server <tcp_listen_port> <udp_target_host> <udp_target_port>

Example:
bash
./bin/tcp_server 9999 127.0.0.1 5140
Accepts TCP clients on port 9999
Forwards all received data to 127.0.0.1:5140 over UDP
Supports concurrent clients via pthreads
💡 Use this when your clients only support TCP but your logging backend is UDP-only.

3. Send Test Logs

bash
./bin/test_client [tcp udp] <host> <port> "<message>"

Examples:
bash
Send via UDP directly to udp_server
./bin/test_client udp 127.0.0.1 5140 "System started"
Send via TCP to tcp_server (which forwards to UDP)
./bin/test_client tcp 127.0.0.1 9999 "Legacy device heartbeat"

Log Format:

[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS][user_message][source_file][line_number]

Example output in log file:

[2025-12-07 10:30:45][System started][/path/to/test_client.c][68]

Key Features
Reliable TCP Sending: The send_all() utility ensures complete transmission even if send() returns partial writes.
Thread-Safe TCP Handling: Each TCP client runs in its own detached thread.
Real-Time Logging: UDP server disables stdio buffering for immediate disk writes.
Zero External Dependencies: Pure POSIX sockets and standard C library.

🛑 Limitations & Considerations
No Encryption or Auth: Intended for trusted networks only.
UDP Is Unreliable: Datagrams may be dropped under load—unsuitable for critical audit logs.
Thread Per Connection: tcp_server scales linearly with clients; not ideal for >1k concurrent connections.
IPv4 Only: No IPv6 support in current version.

🛠️ Development
VS Code Integration

The .vscode/ folder includes:
tasks.json: Build with Ctrl+Shift+B
launch.json: Debug any binary with F5
Extending the System

Possible enhancements:
Add TLS support for secure TCP transport
Implement log rotation in udp_server
Support configuration files

Add metrics (e.g., message rate, client count)
Migrate to epoll/kqueue for high-concurrency TCP
